## Chapter 6: Optimizing for Self-Service

### The Self-Service Revolution

**Old Model (IT-Centric):**
- Data modelers design schemas
- ETL developers create jobs
- BI developers build reports
- Analysts consume reports

**New Model (Self-Service):**
- Analysts find data
- Analysts prepare data
- Analysts analyze data
- IT provides infrastructure

### Business Analyst Workflow

#### 1. Finding and Understanding Data (60% of time)
**Challenges:**
- Cryptic technical names
- "Tribal knowledge" in people's heads
- Millions of data sets

**Solutions:**
- Crowdsource knowledge
- Automate annotation
- Create searchable catalogs

#### 2. Establishing Trust

**Three Pillars:**

| Pillar | What It Tells | How to Measure |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Data Quality** | How clean/complete | Profiling, rules |
| **Lineage** | Where it came from | Track transformations |
| **Stewardship** | Who owns it | Data owners, SMEs |

**Data Quality Rules:**
- Completeness (not empty)
- Data type (correct format)
- Range (within bounds)
- Cardinality (unique values)
- Referential integrity (relationships)

#### 3. Provisioning Data
**Traditional:** Pre-defined permissions, legacy access
**Modern:** Request-based, time-limited access

#### 4. Preparing Data
**Operations:**
- **Shaping** - Select, join, aggregate
- **Cleaning** - Fill missing, correct errors
- **Blending** - Harmonize across sources

#### 5. Analysis and Visualization
Tools: Tableau, Qlik, Power BI, Arcadia Data

### The New Role of IT
**From Gatekeeper → Shopkeeper**

| Old Role | New Role |
|----------|----------|
| Keep people out | Invite people in |
| Control all access | Provision for self-service |
| Build everything | Provide infrastructure |
| Restrict data | Prepare and present data |
